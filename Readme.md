This project uses my base grunt.js template. I added Node.js running Express and using EJS to this project. 
Originally, this was meant to be part of a website but after evaluating my needs realized this was not necessary.

Google Maps was first customized by myself by reading the documentation (https://developers.google.com/maps/tutorials/customizing/). After customizing it I realized using a plugin may be more efficient.
